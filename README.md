### Creates incrementing labels for the Brother QL-710W  

---

âœ¨ **Perfect for labeling items sold live on Whatnot!** âœ¨  

---

You can adapt this tool for other purposes, but it was specifically designed to streamline labeling for live sales on Whatnot. 

ðŸ’¡ Use a stream deck key for each category (or weight) of item you sell & it's one tap to be ready to move to the next auction.

ðŸš€ **Future Plans:**  
More useful tools for Whatnot sellers may be added in the future.  

ðŸ†˜ **Have a specific need?**  
Drop an issue, and Iâ€™ll see if I can help automate it!
